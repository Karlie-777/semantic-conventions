# Semantic conventions for browser events

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

This document defines semantic conventions for browser (web) instrumentations
that emit events.

## WebVital Event

<!-- semconv event.browser.web_vital -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- markdownlint-capture -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

The event name MUST be `browser.web_vital`.

This event describes the website performance metrics introduced by Google, See [web vitals](https://web.dev/vitals).

**Body fields:**

:warning: Body fields will be moved to complex attributes once the
semantic convention tooling supports complex attributes
(see [#1870](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/issues/1870)).

| Body Field  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `delta` | double | The delta between the current value and the last-reported value. See [delta](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals?tab=readme-ov-file#report-only-the-delta-of-changes). | `0.2` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `id` | string | A unique ID representing this particular metric instance. | `v3-1677874579383-6381583661209` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `name` | enum | Name of the web vital. | `cls` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `value` | double | Value of the web vital. | `1.0` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

`name` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `cls` | Cumulative Layout Shift. See [cls](https://web.dev/articles/cls). | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `fid` | First Input Delay. See [fid](https://web.dev/articles/fid). | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `inp` | Interation to Next Paint. See [inp](https://web.dev/articles/inp). | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `lcp` | Largest Contentful Paint. See [lcp](https://web.dev/articles/lcp). | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

## Resource Timing Event

<!-- semconv event.browser.resource_timing -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- markdownlint-capture -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

The event name MUST be `browser.resource_timing`.

This event describes the timing metrics as provided by PerformanceResourceTiming Performance API. These metrics are related to fetching a resource, such as XMLHttpRequest, Fetch, sendBeacon APIs, SVG, image or script.

This event captures data from the [ResourceTiming](https://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing/). It is recommended to be captured by using the PerformanceResourceTiming API. If the page starts unloading before the page loads, then the partial data can be captured by calling the [performance.getEntriesByType](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/getEntriesByType) method.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`url.full`](/docs/attributes-registry/url.md) | string | Absolute URL describing a network resource according to [RFC3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986) [1] | `https://www.foo.bar/search?q=OpenTelemetry#SemConv`; `//localhost` | `Required` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

**[1] `url.full`:** Generally the url doesn't include any query strings or any leading credentials, and it's formatted as scheme://full domain/path only, for example https://user:pwd@www.example.com/path?a=b&c=d would be sent as https://www.example.com/path by both removing any potential PII and reducing the cardinality of the name.

**Body fields:**

:warning: Body fields will be moved to complex attributes once the
semantic convention tooling supports complex attributes
(see [#1870](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/issues/1870)).

| Body Field  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
