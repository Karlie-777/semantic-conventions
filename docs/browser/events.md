# Semantic conventions for browser events

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

This document defines semantic conventions for browser (web) instrumentations
that emit events.

## Resource Timing Event

The event name MUST be `browser.resource_timing`.

This event describes the timing metrics as provided by PerformanceResourceTiming Performance API. These metrics are related to fetching a resource, such as XMLHttpRequest, Fetch, sendBeacon APIs, SVG, image or script.

This event captures data from the [ResourceTiming](https://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing/). It is recommended to be captured by using the PerformanceResourceTiming API. If the page starts unloading before the page loads, then the partial data can be captured by calling the [performance.getEntriesByType](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/getEntriesByType) method.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`url.full`](/docs/attributes-registry/url.md) | string | Absolute URL describing a network resource according to [RFC3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986) [1] | `https://www.foo.bar/search?q=OpenTelemetry#SemConv`; `//localhost` | `Required` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

**[1] `url.full`:** Generally the url doesn't include any query strings or any leading credentials, and it's formatted as scheme://full domain/path only, for example https://user:pwd@www.example.com/path?a=b&c=d would be sent as https://www.example.com/path by both removing any potential PII and reducing the cardinality of the name.

**Body fields:**

| Body Field  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `connectEnd` | double | The time immediately after the browser finishes establishing the connection to the server to retrieve the resource. The timestamp value includes the time interval to establish the transport connection, as well as other time intervals such as SSL handshake and SOCKS authentication. completes, and it is measured in milliseconds. | `476.6000000014906` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `connectStart` | double | The time immediately immediately before the user agent starts establishing the connection to the server to retrieve the resource, and it is measured in milliseconds. | `476.6000000014901` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `domainLookupEnd` | double | The time immediately after the browser finishes the domain name lookup for the resource, and it is measured in milliseconds. | `100.6000000014906` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `domainLookupStart` | double | The time immediately before the browser starts the domain name lookup for the resource, and it is measured in milliseconds. | `100.6000000014901` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `fetchStart` | double | The time immediately before the browser starts to fetch the resource, and it is measured in milliseconds. | `9.600000000558794` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `requestStart` | double | The time immediately before the browser starts requesting the resource from the server, cache, or local resource. If the transport connection fails and the browser retires the request, the value returned will be the start of the retry request, and it is measured in milliseconds. | `506.70000000298023` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `responseEnd` | double | The time immediately after the browser receives the last byte of the resource or immediately before the transport connection is closed, whichever comes first, and it is measured in milliseconds. | `510.6000000014906` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `responseStart` | double | The time immediately after the browser receives the first byte of the response from the server, cache, or local resource, and it is measured in milliseconds. | `508.6000000014901` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `secureConnectionStart` | double | The time immediately before immediately before the browser starts the handshake process to secure the current connection, and it is measured in milliseconds. | `476.6000000014903` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
