    brief: >
      This event describes the timing metrics as provided by PerformanceResourceTiming Performance API.
      These metrics are related to fetching a resource, such as
      XMLHttpRequest, Fetch, sendBeacon APIs, SVG, image or script.
    note: >
      This event captures data from the [ResourceTiming](https://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing/).
      It is recommended to be captured by using the PerformanceResourceTiming API.
      If the page starts unloading before the page loads,
      then the partial data can be captured by calling the [performance.getEntriesByType](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/getEntriesByType) method.

        requirement_level: required
        note: >
          Generally the url doesn't include any query strings or any leading credentials,
          and it's formatted as scheme://full domain/path only, for example https://user:pwd@www.example.com/path?a=b&c=d
          would be sent as https://www.example.com/path by both removing any potential PII and reducing the cardinality of the name.
